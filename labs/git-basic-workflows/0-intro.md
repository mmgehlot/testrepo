# A brief introduction to Git

Learn how to use Git to download, edit and revise source code! Git is used to manage files on your computer so that when you make changes, you see that there is a new version of the file and can compare old and new. This aspect of file management is called version control. Git also enables you to coordinate work with others on new versions of files.

## Objectives

The objective of this lab is to learn how to:

1. Understand what problems Version Control Systems help us solve.
2. Learn and practice your first Git workflows! This will enable you to:
   * Get our sample-code on your workstation.
   * Create a "safe place" for you to make and commit your changes.
   * Learn how to incrementally save your code changes.

## Prerequisites

To complete this lab you need:

- A development environment with typical tools and applications.
    - [X] If you are at a DevNet Event using a provided workstation, you are ready to go.
    - [ ] If you are working from your own workstation, please review the ***"How to setup your own computer"*** link at the top of this page.
