## Where to go to learn more

We have only just scratched the surface of what Git can do. As you advance your development skills, you will need to learn more about Git (or your VCS of choice).

Here are some good references to resources that can help you learn more about Git:

* [git-scm.com Tutorials and Recommended Books](https://git-scm.com/doc/ext)
* Cisco DevNet Learning Labs:
    * [Git 100: Basics of the git version control system](https://developer.cisco.com/learning/lab/git-intro/step/1)
    * [Git 101: Branching](https://developer.cisco.com/learning/lab/git-branching/step/1)
    * [Git 102: Using git with servers](https://developer.cisco.com/learning/lab/git-servers/step/1)
