# Intro to Python - Part 2

Python is an awesome “batteries included” programming language.  Learn about Python’s powerful built-in data structures, collections, and loops.  Then learn how Python files are structured, executed, and how to debug them.

## Objectives

The objective of this training is to learn:

* How to create and use Python’s list, tuple, and dictionary data structures.
* Where to go to find other collections.
* Python’s two looping mechanisms and when to use them.
* How Python files are structured and executed.
* Basic debugging tools and processes.

## Prerequisites

**If you are at a DevNet event and using a provided workstation**, you will be ready to go. You will have:

* A development environment with typical tools and applications.
* A local copy of the required sample code repository. Depending on your event, you will be using one of the following repositories:
    - **dnav3-code**
    - **dne-security-code**
    - **dciv2-code**
    - **meraki-code**

**If you are working from your own workstation**, please review the ***"How to setup your own computer"*** link at the top of this page.

You should also have an understanding of these foundational topics:

* The previous labs in the **"Python Fundamentals"** Learning Lab Module:
  - **"A Brief Introduction to Git"**
  - **"Intro to Python - Part 1"**

## Introduction

Community-developed Python takes a "batteries included" approach to the language and its included [Standard Library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html). This means that many of the things that you might want to do are probably already included in the language's native syntax, data types or libraries. This can not only save you time, but help you use and leverage higher quality and "battle hardened" code and functionality already created by the Python community.

You have already seen some examples of this. Like the string's native `.format()`, `.split()`, and `.join()` methods and there are [more where those came from](https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html).

In Part 2, we take a look at some of the collection data types included in Python, and powerfully simple loops and tools we can use to work with these collections.
