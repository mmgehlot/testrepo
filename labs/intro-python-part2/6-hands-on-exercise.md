# Step 6: Hands-on exercise

We've covered a lot in this lab:

* Python data structures
* Python collections
* Loops
* The structure and execution of a Python file
* Basic debugging tools

Hopefully you have taken the time to experiment with the syntax and topics we introduced as you worked through the lab.  Now, test your fingers by working through the following coding exercise to review what we've done:

1. DevNet Express Events

  - If you are at **DevNet Express for DNA**, open

    - `~/code/dne-security-code/intro-python/part2/fortune_cookie.py` in your editor, from cloning the `dnav3-code` repository.</br></br>

  - If you are at **DevNet Express for Security**, open

    - `~/code/dne-security-code/intro-python/part2/fortune_cookie.py` in your editor, from cloning the `dne-security-code` repository.</br></br>

  - If you are at **DevNet Express for Data Center Infrastructure**, open
    - `dciv2-code/intro-python/part2/fortune_cookie.py` in your editor, from cloning the `dciv2-code` repository.</br></br>

  You cloned one of these repositories to your computer as part of the "Using Git to Copy Code and Setting Up the Local Environment" procedures.

2. Review the script's structure and intended flow.

3. Complete `create_fortune_cookie_message()` function (see the  "TODO" task in the script).

4. Run your script in your Terminal.

    ```shell
    $ python intro-python/part2/fortune_cookie.py
    ```

> **Note:** Remember your debugging skills. If you have a hard time visualizing the flow of the script, add some `print()` statements. If you want to experiment with calling the functions and seeing what they return, use the interactive shell.

When complete, your script should run without generating any errors.

### Did your code work?

Awesome.  Don't forget to use `git add <filename>` and `git commit -m "Your commit message"` to save your success!
