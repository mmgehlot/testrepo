## Where to go to learn more

At this point, you have learned a lot!  You should now be able to:

* Read, understand, modify, and follow the flow of Python scripts.
* Understand Python's basic data types and structures.
* Be able to create and work with Python's conditionals, functions, and loops.

...but there is SO much more to learn!  Become a Pythonista and life-long learner by continuing to sharpen your developer skills:

The following classes and/or instructional resources (some free, some with low but reasonable costs) help you dive deeper and get a more sure foundation in the Python programming language:

### For beginners:
