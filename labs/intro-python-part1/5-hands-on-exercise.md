# Step 5: Hands-on exercise

Let's see how well we did.  Try your hand at the following exercise to review what we've done in this lab:

1. DevNet Express Events

  - If you are at **DevNet Express for DNA**, open

    - `~/code/dnav3-code/intro-python/part1/hands_on_exercise.py` in your editor, from cloning the `dnav3-code` repository.</br></br>

  - If you are at **DevNet Express for Security**, open

    - `~/code/dne-security-code/intro-python/part1/hands_on_exercise.py` in your editor, from cloning the `dne-security-code` repository.</br></br>

  - If you are at **DevNet Express for Data Center Infrastructure**, open
    - `dciv2-code/intro-python/part1/hands_on_exercise.py` in your editor, from cloning the `dciv2-code` repository.</br></br>

  You cloned one of these repositories to your computer as part of the "Using Git to Copy Code and Setting Up the Local Environment" procedures.

2. Complete each of the `TODO` tasks.
3. Run your script in your Terminal.

```shell
$ python intro-python/part1/hands_on_exercise.py
```
