# Intro to Python: part 1

This module will teach you the building blocks on which all great apps are built: basic data types, variables, conditionals, and functions.

## Objectives

The objective of this training is to learn:

* How to use your Python interpreter.
* Pythonâ€™s basic data types and how to define variables.
* How to use dot "." syntax to access methods and attributes inside objects.
* How to use conditionals to inspect variables and control the flow of your program.
* How to create functions that modularize your code and make it easier to scale, maintain and reuse.

## Prerequisites

**If you are at a DevNet event and using a provided workstation**, you will be ready to go. You will have:

* A development environment with typical tools and applications.
* A local copy of the required sample code repository. Depending on your event, you will be using one of the following repositories:
    - **dnav3-code**
    - **dne-security-code**
    - **dciv2-code**
    - **meraki-code**

**If you are working from your own workstation**, please review the ***"How to setup your own computer"*** link at the top of this page.

You should also have an understanding of these foundational topics:
