# Why Code?

I design and manage networks of all sizes.  I use IEEE 802.1w, IPv4, IPv6, OSPF, and BGP to build communications networks that would make Bob Kahn and Vint Cerf proud.  Why should I learn to code?

## Objectives

The objective of this lab is to show:

1. The Value-Proposition:  Why engineers should learn to code.
2. What Changed:  A brief run-down on how coding has advanced to the point of being useful to infrastructure engineers.
3. Your Future Job Role:  What your day-to-day job may look like in this new world.
4. Why Python: Why we choose the Python language for this module and track.

## Prerequisites

To complete this lab you need:

* An open mind.
* Preexisting mad engineering skills.

**Next: The value proposition**
