# Step 4: Why Python?

We could have chosen one of several languages for this track, but we chose Python. Here's why:

* **Domain Applicability**: For network and IT infrastructure engineers, there is a well established online community of infrastructure engineers using Python to deploy and maintain IT systems. This means you can leverage (and contribute to) the work done by this collective community to save yourself (and others) time as we all strive to complete common tasks together.

   Yes, there are infrastructure engineers using other languages, and those languages are in no way inferior to Python. Python appears to have the broadest community (to date) for our domain.

* **Power and Flexibility**: As already discussed, Python is a modern language that brings coding into the level-of-effort range of being useful to infrastructure engineers. Python is a ["batteries included"](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0206/) language with a rich and diverse developer ecosystem. This means that it will serve you well as you progress in your journey. If your work leads to you needing to: create a backend web service, interact with a data base, do some data analysis, work with machine learning algorithms, or create a simple (or powerful) command line tool, Python and its developer community have you covered.  You shouldn't have to "start from scratch," and you should be able to get powerful tasks done with reasonable investments of effort.

* **Platform Flexibility**: Your Python scripts can run: on a computer (Windows, macOS, or Linux), on a server, in a VM, in a container, in the cloud, and on some Cisco IOS devices. This means you can use Python to create scripts that can run in a variety of places to fit the needs of your use case.

* **Authors' Bias**: The authors of this module are industry experts who are ~~highly biased~~ _a little biased_ towards Python. We have stickers on our laptops, t-shirts, social profiles, and emotional connections to our code that make us _a little partial_.  üòÅ

If you are still with us, you are ready to start learning to code!
