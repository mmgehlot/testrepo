# Step 3: Your future job role

**Q: If I proceed through this journey, am I going to have to become a software developer?**.<br/>
*A: No. You will become a more capable engineer.*

As engineers start making investments in learning programming languages and how to use software-developer tools, they can have a bit of an identity crisis as they start asking themselves questions like:

* I'm a sharp engineer, but why can't I get my code to run!?!
* Are these the skills employers are going to value?
* I like designing, configuring, and operating networks, am I leaving that behind to start writing code?
* This can be frustrating sometimes; isn't this why I switch my college major from Computer Science to Art History?
* What am I doing!?!

Don't worry! Everyone who has started on this journey has experience the same thoughts and questions. Let me provide some reassurances to these questions and concerns:

* Coding may be new to you, but if you are an engineer working with Cisco infrastructures, you are already a sharp technical resource.
* The last time you started working with a new piece of sophisticated technology, did it work seamlessly and effortlessly the first time you touched it? Yeah, this is going to take some time investment as well.
* Employers value the expertise you bring in being able to design, deploy, and operate IT infrastructures and applications.  Learning to code, automate routine tasks, and create interconnections between IT systems is going to make you an even more valuable resource.
* All technology can, at times, be frustrating. As your competency with this new tech progresses, your frustration will decrease and your accomplishment will increase. Working with APIs and Programmability can be rewarding as you begin to create things and innovate processes by combining these new skills with your existing technical capabilities.

If you get into this tech and decide you love it and want to spend more time developing more complex applications and engaging in more traditional software-development work...that's up to you.

For our purposes, as infrastructure engineers, we want to develop our coding skills and learn how to use these new developer tools to make us _**more capable engineers**_.  At the end of this journey _(right, like there is ever an end to learning!)_ ðŸ˜‚, we will still be engineers working in the disciplines we work in - only now sharper and more capable of deploying and operating larger and more complex infrastructures - because we can use technology to work with technology.

**Next step: Why Python?**
